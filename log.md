## Create a ScreenSaver
**Progress**
Create a screensaver with Windows Form application that has a transparent background to see if the native windows 10 screensaver allows for a view of the desktop if given a transparent screensaver.  This includes a placeholder for a logo which provides a slightly visible item on the screen.  This allow the user to be aware that the screen saver is on. This currently only works in Test and Preview, but not when the screensaver is activated with the time by the screensaver configure form.

**Learned**
The screensaver is not the only thing loaded.  There are other backgrounds that cover the desktop even when the screensaver is transparent.  This only occurs when the screensaver is ran normally (i.e. not in test or preveiw mode). Preventing the user from seeing the desktop solely using a transparent screensaver.
